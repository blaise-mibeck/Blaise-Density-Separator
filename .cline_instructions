- OS: Windows + PowerShell, venv environment. I'm on Windows using PowerShell and Python venv.
- Preferred liabraries: QtPy, Pandas, Plotly, MatPlotLib, Numpy, ScientificPython, SciPy, 
Code Organization Rules:
- Keep Python files under 250 lines
- Split files when they exceed 300 lines
- One main responsibility per file
- Always suggest splitting if a file gets too large
- Prefer multiple small files over one large file
